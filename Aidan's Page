<h1>A Page About Aidan</h1>

<p>Aidan is a 4th year philosophy student and the University of British Columbia. He has worked in

<ul>

<li> Summer Camps

<li> After School Programs

<li> A Federal Electoral Campaign

<li> And the UBC Philosophy Department.

</ul>

</p>



<p> He is currently working on content creation and a quadratic funding project. Both are part of his ultimate aim to promote altruistic behaviour in areas where egoism harms everybody. He also just realized a few things about keeping one’s global vs. local outlooks in check. For instance, arguing that Canadians shouldn’t have children due to land overpopulation in Nigeria constitutes a failure to keep one’s global outlook in its proper lane. And arguing that one should be lauded for ‘keeping their money in the local economy’ over and above buying products from developing nations is a failure to keep one’s local outlook in its proper lane.Therefore, “think global, act local” is an underdeveloped idea. And anyways… Aidan is concerned with egoism and the wellbeing of communities.</p>
